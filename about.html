                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Cars</dt>
                    <dd>Cars and rally racing have been an obsession of mine for as long as I can remember. There’s something about the precision and raw power of these machines that never fails to capture my attention. Rally racing, in particular, is so unique because it combines the thrill of speed with the unpredictability of the terrain. From gravel roads to snow-covered tracks, drivers and co-drivers must be in perfect sync, making split-second decisions that can make or break their race. The skill required to navigate these demanding conditions, coupled with the technical prowess behind the cars, makes rally racing one of the most captivating forms of motorsport for me. The intense focus on both the car's performance and the driver’s ability to adapt to ever-changing environments is what truly sets it apart.</dd>
                    <dt>Photography</dt>
                    <dd>Dabbling in photography has become one of my favorite creative outlets. There’s something incredibly rewarding about capturing a moment or scene through the lens and being able to see the world from a new perspective. I started with a simple DSLR, experimenting with different settings and learning the basics of composition, lighting, and exposure. Over time, I’ve found myself increasingly drawn to the art of storytelling through photos, whether it’s a quiet, reflective landscape or the energy of a bustling city street. Photography allows me to pause and really appreciate the little details—things I might otherwise overlook in the rush of daily life. It’s not just about taking a picture; it’s about conveying a feeling or capturing an essence that words might not do justice. Each shot feels like a challenge to push my skills further, and that’s what makes it so exciting.</dd>
                    <dt>Reading</dt>
                    <dd>Reading has always been a way for me to escape into different worlds and perspectives. Whether it's diving into a thrilling novel, exploring thought-provoking nonfiction, or losing myself in poetry, books offer a kind of depth and richness that you just can’t get anywhere else. I love how reading can be both a solitary escape and a way to connect with others, especially when I share a good book recommendation or discuss a story with friends. It’s amazing how a well-written book can completely shift your mindset or give you a new way of thinking about life. I’ve always been drawn to stories that push boundaries, whether through complex characters, intricate plots, or exploring different cultures and times. The act of reading itself is like a quiet adventure, one where I get to experience new emotions and ideas with each page I turn.</dd>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>As a future software developer who is currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree, my greatest dream is to continually develop a strong computer science background while gaining experience through real project work. Out of the many things I hope to achieve, I especially want to become a master of full-stack development and being equally comfortable with frontend and backend technologies. This ofcourse takes time and I am continously working on it, sharpening my skills and understanding everyday but also setting short term goals that will help pave the way towards achieving my ideals.
                <br>
                One of my immediate objectives is to contribute to open-source projects, which will not only improve my coding abilities but also familiarize me with collaborative development environments. I am very keen to solve problems and plan to participate in coding contests and competitions to enhance my problem solving approach.
                <br>
                On the other hand, in the distant future, I aim to specialize in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, or cloud computing, depending on my interest and ability. Inorder to be skilled enough to get there I believe it is cruicial for me to do internship with a local company where I get to learn from experienced engineers and get some perspective on the dynamics of software development within a corporate setup.
                <br>
                I believe in lifelong learning which is why I plan to go after certifications and enhance my skills further after graduation. As such, pursuing a Masters or even a PhD in software engineering will be a great deal for me. As of now, finally, I also plan to build and continuously update a portfolio of meaningful projects representing my technical proficiency and creativity.</p>
